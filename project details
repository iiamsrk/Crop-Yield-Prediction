# Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning

This is a basic machine learning project to predict crop yield based on crop type, area, rainfall, and temperature.

## Features Used
- Crop (Rice, Wheat, Maize)
- Area (in hectares)
- Rainfall (in mm)
- Temperature (in Celsius)

## Model Used
- Random Forest Regressor

## Output
- Predicts crop yield in tons.
